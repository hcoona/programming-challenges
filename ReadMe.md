## 110102 Minesweeper

As simple as naive.

## 110103 The Trip

Difficult. I think there should be an algorithm with $O(n)$ complexity, but my solution is $O(n \lg n)$.

The core idea is quite naive: if the average is not an integer, there must be part of people shoud be adjusted to the ceiling of average, and the others flooring of average.

## 110104 LC-Display

Straight forward.

Several design pattern could be used here to increase the readability of codes. I really agree that **The Design Patterns are bad smells**, the code should be much simpler than what it currently is if I could use C# instead.

## 110105 Graphical Editor

Easy. Use flood fill for region fill.

## 110106 Interpreter

Don't know why getting WA.
