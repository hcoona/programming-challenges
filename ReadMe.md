# My Answer for book *Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual*

## 110101 The $3n + 1$ problem

Still not solved for the worst situation.

## 110102 Minesweeper

As simple as naive.

## 110103 The Trip

Very difficult. I think there should be an algorithm with $O(n)$ complexity, but my solution is $O(n \lg n)$.

The core idea is quite naive: if the average is not an integer, there must be part of people shoud be adjusted to the ceiling of average, and the others flooring of average.
